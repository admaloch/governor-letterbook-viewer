# governor-letterbook-viewer

This is a simple research tool built to assist patrons of The State Archives of Florida - Division of Library and Information Services - Florida Department of State. 
The archives have scanned of over 30,000 images of Governor Richard K. Call's letterbooks and are often requested by patrons who are studying Florida history. The images were already hosted on the Florida Memory website server, but were not easily accessible. The intent of this project was to build a simple client-side tool that can grab the links to these images and organize them so they can be more easily viewed and downloaded. The images were digitized into 32 seperate volumes based on the date written. 

Note - This application is not part of the Florida Memory website or hosted on the same server. For security reasons, the download feature will only work if the files are present as is the case for the offical version hosted in the State Archives reference area. The full version of this appliction is available to the public.
